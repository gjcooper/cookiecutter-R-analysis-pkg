# Notes

All files in this subdirectory should be the result of preprocessing the raw input data from the input directory at this same level.
They should be created by the scripts included in the package and include the data in a raw form but RData format, the cleaned data (outliers removed) and particular subsets of the data.
They should all also be able to be regenerated at will.
